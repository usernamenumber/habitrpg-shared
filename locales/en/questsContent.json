You follow the roars and growls - punctuated by another voice's cackling - to a clearing in the woods where you see a fully-grown polar bear. She's caged and shackled, roaring for life. Dancing atop the cage is a malicious little imp wearing castaway Christmas costumes. Vanquish Trapper Santa, and save the beast!",

You take her back to the stables, where Matt Boch the whisperer listens to her tale with a gasp of horror. She has a cub! He ran off into the icefields when mama bear was captured. Help her find her baby!",
