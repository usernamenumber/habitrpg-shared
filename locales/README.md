HabitRPG's translations are managed on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/habitrpg/).

The files in this folder are automatically pulled from Transifex, with expcetion of 
the original English strings which are managed directly through GitHub. 

Before starting to translate, please give a look at [this](https://trello.com/c/SvTsLdRF/12-translations) Trello card.
